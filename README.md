# The dotnet.social community

This repository contains everything technical and organizational about the dotnet.social community.

The goal is to share as most details as possible in public with other people to gather ideas, help and suggestions about the management of this mastodon instance.

This community is small, only maintained for now by one person (@tbolon), but I found the idea of having a community on a @dotnet.social domain interesting.
Not because people should only speak about dotnet here, but as a statement that dotnet is part of our work-life and that we are proud of that.
It does not suggest that we are narrow-minded or not interested in other technologies, in fact it's the complete opposite: we are curious, open-minded, and interested in our day-to-day domain: coding and technologies.

## Ask for help

We are (I am) looking for volunteers to help writing rules, discuss content, proof-reading, manage rules and bring more content.
Even (and firstly) rewrite this readme to correct grammar mistakes!

We encourage you to participate in this repository if you have any resources, knowledge, energy or just time and motivation to help this community.

* Create issues if you have detected problems or want to suggest something
* Use discussions to ask questions, suggest ideas
* Use mastodon, mention me at styx31@dotnet.social

## Technical details

The current dotnet.social server is a virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure, and located in West Europe.
It's a Standard D2s v3 VM with 2 vcpus and 8 GiB memory, running on Ubuntu 20.04.
The OS disk is a Premium SSL LRS of 30GiB. An additional data disk of 128GiB premium SSD LRS is attached to the virtual machine to store medias.
The resource group also contains a storage account (RA-GRS) used to backup all critical resources of the server daily.

## Financial details

All these resources are billed under a single Azure subscription, a Visual Studio Enterprise Azure Credits Benefits that I (@tbolon) dedicate to this server.
The credits are of $130 per month and are almost entirely used by these resources.
I paid the domain on my own name, on gandi.net, until the end of 2024 (for 90â‚¬).

So, as of now, this community does not need external financial help.

But, as this instance grows, we will certainly face more charges and will perhaps require participation (donation?).

Also, as a community, we are also interested in free resources and sponsorship if it makes sense: for example, an Azure sponsorship, monitoring tools free credits, or anything that could help this community.

## Scripts and maintenance

This repository is also cloned on the server itself and contains scripts which are used to maintain and administrate the server.
This way, everyone can look at the configuration, scripts, and attest how things are done and make any suggestion to help make this server more robust.

* the `/scripts` folder to find all scripts used on the server
* the `/configs` folder contains all configuration files copied from the server when they are modified

Data on the server are copied on the azure blob storage account each night, using the `/scripts/backup.sh` script.
This script upload backup data each day, keeping last 7 days by using the current day of week as a part of the remote url.

## Mastodon instance

TODO: explain how mastodon was instaled and the differences applied, more precisely regarding the location of the public files on `/datadrive/`
